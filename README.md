# Divaprotocol Dapp

## Getting Started

We're using `yarn` for depdency management. It's features are pretty much the same as for npm. If you know how to use npm, you already know how to use yarn.

1. `npm install -g yarn` if you haven't got yarn on your machine yet.
2. Run `yarn` in this repository to install all dependencies.
3. Run `yarn start` to start the application and development server at localhost:3000

## scripts

- `yarn start` Starts the app in development mode
- `yarn test` Runs tests
- `yarn build` Builds applications for deployment (output can be found in `build` folder)
