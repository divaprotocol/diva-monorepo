# What is it #

A simple database dump web application inspired by Nick Plante's [toopaste](https://github.com/zapnap/toopaste) project
showing how to use **RethinkDB as a backend for Sinatra applications**.

# Complete stack #

*   [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)
*   [RethinkDB](http://www.rethinkdb.com)

# Installation #

```
