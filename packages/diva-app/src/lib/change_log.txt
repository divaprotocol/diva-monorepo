TODO:
- Remove diva-contracts folder 
  -> Load DIVA ABI from ABI file, i.e. replace `import ERC20_ABI from '@diva/contracts/abis/erc20.json'`
- Replace `import ERC20 from '@diva/contracts/abis/erc20.json'`
- Update governance parameter call for submission periods

QUESTIONS:
- Remove `convertExponentialToDecimal` in calcPayoffsPerToken.ts?
- Settlement periods are not longer general but pool specific -> adjust


BUGS:
- SOLVED: In Create Pool, app breaks when Collateral Amount is removed
- OPEN: In Create pool, if you reduce collateral Amount from 10 (default) to 9, say, then error message "Minimum taker contribution must be less than collateral amount" pops up which only makes sense for Create Offer process
- OPEN: When you navigate to create page via menu, then shortRecipient and longRecipient are not set. Only on page reload
