## Context

<!-- Provide any relevant context and other information.
Why should this be implemented? If it's a new feature, provide information about why this is important for users. If it's a change that doesn't affect
users, why else is it important? This will help us triage the issue.
-->

## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- Define acceptance Criteria as a checklist. If an issue is too big, it
is encouraged to split it into several issues.

Example:
- [ ] Users should be able to view a list of all their transactions in the app
- [ ] Transaction list should be visible in separate tab
